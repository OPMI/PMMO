# PMMO
PMMO: Precision Medicine Metadata Ontology

PMMO is a community-based precision medicine metadata ontology.

PMMO is being developed based on the Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation ([OPMI](https://github.com/OPMI/opmi)). Generally speaking, PMMO can be considered as a subset of OPMI but it includes more metadata-related features.

The development of PMMO is supported by KPMP: https://kpmp.org.
